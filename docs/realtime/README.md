## 🎯 Real-Time Features in Our App

Our application has three main real-time features:

### 1. **Presence Avatars** 👥

See who else is viewing the same project as you in real-time.

### 2. **Live Cursors** 🖱️

See other users' mouse cursors moving around (like Figma!).

### 3. **Instant Updates** ⚡

When someone creates, updates, or deletes a task or status, everyone sees it immediately.
